# Handoff for Next Agent

## 🚀 Status Update
**Current Version**: 0.3.0 (Commit Stage)
**Branch**: `0.3`

I have successfully implemented the **HiveMind Design Mode** and fixed the **Execution to Handoff flow**.

## ✅ Completed Tasks

### 1. HiveMind Design Mode 🐝
- **Frontend**:
  - Added "🐝 Hive Mode" button to `DesignView.tsx`.
  - Updated `page.tsx` to spawn Design HiveMind windows.
  - Updated `HiveMindView.tsx` to support `design` type and stream from the new endpoint.
- **Backend**:
  - Created `devussy-web/api/design_hivemind.py` to handle multi-agent design generation.
  - Updated `dev_server.py` to route `/api/design/hivemind` requests.
- **Documentation**:
  - Updated `README.md` and `devussy-web/README.md` to reflect the new feature.

### 2. Execution Phase Improvements 🛠️
- **Manual Handoff Control**:
  - Added a "Proceed to Handoff" button to `ExecutionView.tsx`.
  - Disabled auto-advance to allow users to review execution outputs before proceeding.
  - Added helper logic to build the detailed plan for handoff.

### 3. Critical Bug Fixes 🐛
- **Handoff Generation**:
  - Fixed `TypeError: HandoffPromptGenerator() takes no arguments`.
  - Fixed `AttributeError: 'ProjectDesign' object has no attribute 'phases'` (argument mismatch).
  - Fixed `AttributeError: 'ProjectDesign' object has no attribute 'architecture'` (field name mismatch).
  - Fixed `TypeError: object HandoffPrompt can't be used in 'await' expression` (async fix).
  - Ensured `project_design.md` in zip contains full content by using `raw_llm_response`.
- **Window Management**:
  - Implemented auto-open for "New Project" window.
  - Improved default window sizes.
  - Added Help system with single-instance window logic.
- **Checkpoints**:
  - Fixed loading logic to correctly restore the "Handoff" window from a checkpoint.

## 🧪 Verification
- **HiveMind**: Verified that clicking the Hive Mode button in Design phase opens the 4-pane window and streams content from the backend.
- **Execution**: Verified that the "Proceed to Handoff" button appears and is enabled after execution stops.
- **Server**: Restarted `dev_server.py` to ensure all API endpoints are active.

## 📋 Next Steps
1.  **Full Pipeline Testing**: Run a complete end-to-end test from Interview to Handoff to ensure smooth transitions between all phases.
2.  **UI Polish**:
    - Consider adding a "Regenerate" option for HiveMind if the user wants to try again.
    - Improve the visual distinction between "Phase" HiveMind and "Design" HiveMind windows.
3.  **Handoff HiveMind**: (Optional) Consider adding Hive Mode to the Handoff phase for multi-perspective documentation generation.

## 🔧 Technical Notes
- The backend server runs on port `8000`.
- The frontend runs on port `3000`.
- HiveMind uses SSE (Server-Sent Events) for streaming.
- The `HiveMindManager` in `src/pipeline/hivemind.py` is shared between Plan and Design modes.

Good luck! 🚀
