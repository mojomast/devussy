Tool Design and Development Plan
Overview

This document outlines the project design and provides a detailed development plan for building an automated tool that creates and maintains a development plan (devplan) and a handoff prompt by orchestrating multiple language models (LLMs). The tool is intended to work with many AI coding services and therefore must remain provider‑agnostic. The final devplan and handoff prompt will be used by a separate “lesser coding agent” to implement the project; therefore all instructions must be explicit, ordered and easily executable.

Why Python?

Python has become the leading programming language for artificial intelligence. A 2024–2025 survey of AI development languages notes that Python is considered the go‑to language for AI due to its clear syntax, vast ecosystem of libraries and frameworks, strong community support and ability to integrate with other technologies
rapidinnovation.io
. These characteristics make Python particularly well suited for orchestrating multiple LLM calls, templating prompts, managing files and integrating version‑control operations. Although the tool could theoretically be implemented in other languages (for example Java or C++), Python’s flexibility and cross‑platform support will facilitate integration with a wide range of LLM providers and AI coding tools.

Key Dependencies and Frameworks

The tool will rely on several Python libraries to handle HTTP requests, asynchronous execution, prompt orchestration and version control. The most important dependencies include:

Asynchronous LLM Calls

Efficient interaction with LLM APIs is critical for this project. The asynchronous programming model in Python, enabled by asyncio, allows multiple API requests to be executed concurrently without blocking the event loop. A guide to asynchronous LLM calls recommends installing aiohttp, openai and optionally langchain and demonstrates using asyncio.gather to send multiple prompts concurrently
unite.ai
. For large workloads, batching requests and controlling concurrency with semaphores helps avoid overwhelming the API servers
unite.ai
. Including retry mechanisms (e.g., via tenacity) ensures resilience to transient network errors
unite.ai
.

Multi‑Agent Workflow Framework

This project can be implemented from scratch or by leveraging a specialized agent framework. LangGraph, a node‑based agentic framework within the LangChain ecosystem, is particularly relevant. It allows developers to define nodes (agent actions) and edges (transitions) for linear, hierarchical and sequential workflows
getstream.io
. Key benefits include:

Free and open‑source under the MIT licence
getstream.io
.

Token‑level streaming support to show intermediate reasoning
getstream.io
.

Enterprise readiness with support for large‑scale deployment and self‑hosted options
getstream.io
.

State persistence enabling pause and resume of agent execution
getstream.io
.

For this project, we recommend using LangGraph to orchestrate the multi‑step process of generating the project design, creating the devplan, breaking it into actionable steps and producing the handoff prompt. However, because the tool must remain provider‑agnostic, the code should abstract away LangGraph behind interfaces so that another framework (e.g., a custom orchestrator or Microsoft Autogen) could be swapped in without major changes.

Development Plan

The following numbered steps outline the complete sequence of tasks required to build the tool. Each step should be executed in order by the development agent. The plan is intentionally detailed to support a less experienced coder. Feel free to adjust step numbers during implementation if tasks are combined or split, but preserve the sequential logic.

Phase 1 – Project Initialization

Set up a repository: Create a new Git repository for the project (local or remote) and initialize it with a README.md, LICENSE (MIT recommended) and .gitignore (including environment files and compiled artifacts).

Define the project structure: Plan a folder hierarchy—e.g., src/ for source code, tests/ for test modules, docs/ for generated documentation, templates/ for prompt templates and config/ for configuration files.

Create a virtual environment: Use Python’s venv or conda to isolate dependencies (e.g., python -m venv venv), activate it, and add venv/ to .gitignore.

Add a requirements.txt: List the key dependencies (see table above). Use pinned versions (e.g., aiohttp==x.y.z, openai==x.y.z) to ensure reproducibility.

Install dependencies: Within the virtual environment, run pip install -r requirements.txt to install all packages.

Set up pre‑commit hooks: Configure pre-commit with flake8, black and isort for consistent formatting. Add instructions to run pre-commit install after cloning.

Initialize Git repository: Commit the initial files and push to remote if applicable.

Create configuration file: Define a config/config.yaml (or .toml) to hold settings such as API providers, model names, concurrency limits, file paths and retry parameters. Use Pydantic to load and validate this configuration at runtime.

Implement configuration loader: In src/config.py, implement a Pydantic model that reads configuration from YAML/TOML and environment variables (via python-dotenv).

Add a script to load environment variables: Provide a .env.example file documenting required variables like OPENAI_API_KEY and instructions for obtaining keys. Include a helper to load .env at runtime.

Phase 2 – Core Abstractions

Define an abstract LLMClient interface: In src/llm_client.py, create a base class with methods generate_completion(prompt: str, **kwargs) -> str and generate_multiple(prompts: List[str]) -> List[str]. Document that implementations must be asynchronous where appropriate.

Implement an OpenAI client: Create src/clients/openai_client.py implementing LLMClient using the openai library. Support both synchronous and asynchronous methods; for asynchronous, rely on AsyncOpenAI and aiohttp as described in the asynchronous LLM guide
unite.ai
.

Implement a Requesty client: Create src/clients/requesty_client.py implementing LLMClient for the requesty.ai API. Use aiohttp to send HTTP requests. Provide placeholders for API endpoints and document the expected request and response formats.

Add a generic OpenAI‑compatible client: Many providers support the OpenAI API schema. Implement a src/clients/generic_client.py that accepts a base URL and API key, enabling calls to any OpenAI‑compatible endpoint.

Create a factory to select clients: In src/clients/factory.py, implement a function that reads the provider name from the configuration and returns the appropriate client instance.

Add concurrency controls: Introduce a wrapper for concurrency limits. For asynchronous calls, use asyncio.Semaphore to restrict the number of concurrent requests; allow configuration via YAML (max_concurrent_requests). Use examples from the asynchronous guide for reference
unite.ai
.

Integrate retry logic: Use tenacity to implement retries with exponential backoff. Create a decorator retry_with_backoff applied to API calls. The asynchronous LLM guide shows how to set up exponential backoff with tenacity
unite.ai
. Add configuration parameters for max_attempts, initial_delay and max_delay.

Define data models for prompts: Using Pydantic, define classes for ProjectDesign, DevPlan, HandoffPrompt, etc. These classes will structure the data passed between modules and facilitate serialization/deserialization to YAML/JSON.

Create a templating engine: Use Jinja2 templates stored in templates/ to generate prompts. For example, a project_design_template.jinja file could accept variables like project_name, objective, languages, and frameworks. Provide templates for the devplan and handoff prompt.

Add a template loader: Implement a function in src/templates.py to load Jinja templates and render them with given context variables.

Implement a file manager: Create src/file_manager.py with functions to read/write Markdown files (devplan and handoff prompt) and update them incrementally. Use Python’s pathlib for path management.

Set up logging: Configure the built‑in logging module to provide debug, info and error logs. Allow log level configuration via the YAML file.

Phase 3 – Prompt Generation Pipeline

Define pipeline stages: The overall process involves several stages: generating the project design, creating the basic devplan, breaking the devplan into actionable steps, and producing the handoff prompt. Represent these stages as nodes in LangGraph or as sequential functions if not using a framework.

Implement the project design generator: Create src/pipeline/project_design.py with a function that calls the selected LLMClient to produce a project design based on user inputs (e.g., languages, frameworks, APIs and requirements). Use a Jinja template to structure the prompt. Include citations where appropriate.

Implement the basic devplan generator: Create src/pipeline/basic_devplan.py. This function will accept the project design and instruct an LLM to outline the devplan at a high level. It should request the LLM to break down the project into major components (e.g., core abstractions, orchestration, testing). Use concurrency if generating multiple sections concurrently.

Implement the detailed devplan generator: Create src/pipeline/detailed_devplan.py. This function will take the basic devplan and ask an LLM to expand each part into numbered actionable steps. Provide context about the target user (“lesser coding agent”) and emphasise clarity and precision. Use asynchronous calls to break sections into separate prompts.

Implement the handoff prompt generator: Create src/pipeline/handoff_prompt.py. This function will produce a prompt instructing the “roo code orchestrator mode” to execute the detailed devplan. The prompt should instruct the orchestrator to update the devplan and documentation as progress is made, commit to Git after every milestone, and create a new handoff prompt when the user requests a handoff.

Compose the full pipeline: In src/pipeline/compose.py, orchestrate calls to the above components in sequence. Use the LangGraph framework to represent each stage as a node; edges will define the flow from project design to devplan to handoff. If not using LangGraph, implement a simple orchestrator that calls each stage sequentially and handles asynchronous execution where necessary.

Support streaming output: For providers that support token streaming (e.g., GPT via OpenAI), implement optional streaming of intermediate results. LangGraph’s streaming support can display agent reasoning steps
getstream.io
. Add an option in the configuration to enable or disable streaming.

Store intermediate results: Use the file manager to save the project design and basic devplan before generating the detailed devplan. This ensures recoverability if the process is interrupted.

Allow manual overrides: Provide an interface (CLI flag or configuration option) that enables the user to supply their own project design or devplan rather than generating them via LLM. This supports custom workflows.

Phase 4 – Command‑Line Interface (CLI)

Choose a CLI framework: Use argparse or typer to build a command‑line interface. typer offers type annotations and rich help messages. Define commands such as generate-design, generate-devplan, generate-handoff, and run-full-pipeline.

Implement CLI commands:

generate-design – Accept user inputs (project name, languages, frameworks, APIs, requirements) and output a project design file.

generate-devplan – Accept an existing project design file and create a basic or detailed devplan.

generate-handoff – Accept a detailed devplan file and create a handoff prompt.

run-full-pipeline – Execute all stages sequentially using the configured LLM provider.

Add CLI options: Provide flags for selecting the provider, specifying concurrency limits, toggling streaming, setting retry parameters and specifying output paths.

Print progress and errors: Use the logging system to display progress messages and report errors. Ensure CLI commands return non‑zero exit codes on failure.

Document CLI usage: Update the README.md with examples for each command, explaining required arguments and configuration options.

Phase 5 – Git Integration

Implement Git wrapper: In src/git_manager.py, use gitpython to perform Git operations. Create functions for commit_changes(message: str), create_branch(name: str), merge_branch(base: str, feature: str) and tag_release(tag: str). Include error handling for repository not found or uncommitted changes.

Integrate Git into the pipeline: Modify the pipeline composition function to call commit_changes after each major milestone (e.g., after generating the basic devplan, after finishing the detailed devplan and after creating the handoff prompt). Use descriptive commit messages (“feat: generate basic devplan”, “docs: update devplan and handoff”).

Support repository initialization: Provide a CLI command init-repo that initializes a Git repository if none exists. Optionally create a remote (GitHub/GitLab) if credentials are supplied.

Write tests for Git operations: Use pytest to simulate Git actions in a temporary directory. Validate that commit messages appear and that branches are created correctly.

Phase 6 – Documentation Generation

Define documentation templates: In templates/docs/, create Jinja templates for the project design report, devplan and handoff prompt. These templates should include headings, lists and tables as appropriate. Avoid long sentences in tables—tables should only contain short phrases or numbers.

Automate documentation updates: Whenever the pipeline generates or updates a devplan or handoff prompt, write the content to Markdown files in docs/. Use the file manager to append new content while retaining previous sections. Document the update in a log file (e.g., docs/update_log.md) with timestamps.

Include citations: When generating the project design and devplan, embed footnote citations following the format 【cursor†Lx-Ly】. Provide a mapping between citations and the relevant source texts. Use Jinja variables to insert citations at the appropriate places.

Add an index page: Generate a docs/index.md linking to the project design, devplan and handoff prompt. Provide a short description of each document and update the index whenever a document is regenerated.

Generate API documentation: Use pdoc or sphinx to produce API documentation from docstrings. Integrate this into the build process and output to docs/api/.

Phase 7 – Testing

Write unit tests for configuration loading: Verify that config/config.yaml values are parsed correctly and that environment variables override file settings.

Test each LLMClient implementation: Mock API responses to ensure the clients return expected data and handle errors gracefully. Use pytest-asyncio to test asynchronous methods.

Test concurrency controls: Simulate high concurrency by issuing multiple asynchronous calls with semaphores set to different values. Ensure that the concurrency limit is respected.

Test retry logic: Mock API failures and verify that tenacity retries occur according to configuration, ultimately raising an exception after the maximum attempts.

Test templating: Provide sample data and ensure that Jinja templates render correctly for project design, devplan and handoff prompts. Check that citations are inserted properly.

Test Git integration: Use a temporary repository to ensure commits, branch creation and merges work as expected. Validate that commit messages correspond to the stage of the pipeline.

Test pipeline composition: End‑to‑end tests should simulate generating a project design, devplan and handoff prompt. Mock LLM responses to ensure that each stage passes data correctly to the next.

Test CLI commands: Use pytest’s capsys or pytest’s CLI runner (if using typer) to test that CLI commands parse options correctly and produce expected output files.

Phase 8 – Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)

Choose a CI platform: Configure GitHub Actions or another CI service to run tests on each push. Include steps to install dependencies, run flake8/black checks, execute unit tests and build documentation.

Add coverage reporting: Use pytest-cov to measure test coverage. Fail the build if coverage falls below a defined threshold (e.g., 80 %).

Publish documentation: Set up the CI to deploy the contents of the docs/ folder to a hosting service (e.g., GitHub Pages). Use a gh-pages branch to store the built documentation.

Automate version tagging: In CI, detect when the main branch’s version number changes (e.g., in pyproject.toml) and automatically tag a release. Include compiled documentation and changelog.

Phase 9 – Runtime Execution and Orchestration

Implement a runtime scheduler: Provide a script src/run_scheduler.py that reads a list of tasks (e.g., prompts for generating devplan sections) and schedules them with concurrency controls. Use asyncio.gather to run tasks concurrently, as shown in the asynchronous guide
unite.ai
.

Handle streaming results: When streaming is enabled, display intermediate outputs to the console or write them to files for debugging. Use callback functions or asynchronous iterators to handle streaming tokens.

Pause and resume workflows: Implement state persistence by saving intermediate states (e.g., partially generated devplan) to a file. Provide functions to resume the pipeline from a saved state. If using LangGraph, leverage its built‑in persistence
getstream.io
.

Allow dynamic provider switching: Expose a CLI option or configuration parameter that allows users to change the LLM provider mid‑workflow. Ensure that the pipeline re‑instantiates the appropriate client using the factory.

Support API rate limits: Integrate rate‑limit handling by catching HTTP 429 responses and applying backoff. Provide user feedback when the pipeline is waiting due to rate limits.

Integrate user feedback: Allow the user to inject comments or corrections into the devplan. Provide a mechanism (e.g., YAML file or CLI prompt) for manual updates and ensure these are preserved when the pipeline regenerates content.

Phase 10 – Finalization and Packaging

Create a setup.py or pyproject.toml: Package the project so it can be installed via pip. Include metadata such as name, version, description, author and dependencies. Configure optional extras (e.g., [dev] extras for testing tools).

Write a comprehensive README.md: Document the purpose of the tool, installation instructions, usage examples, description of configuration options, explanation of the pipeline stages and citation formatting. Provide guidance on how to add support for new LLM providers.

License the project: Include an MIT licence (or another open source licence) with proper copyright attribution.

Publish to PyPI (optional): If you intend to distribute the tool publicly, configure twine to upload the package to PyPI. Prepare a long description (e.g., README.md) and ensure metadata is complete.

Create example projects: Provide sample project designs and devplans in the examples/ directory. These will serve as templates for users and assist with testing.

Gather user feedback: After release, encourage users to file issues, suggest improvements and contribute to the project. Use the feedback to prioritise future enhancements.

Ongoing Maintenance

Update dependencies regularly: Monitor new releases of critical libraries (e.g., openai, langchain, LangGraph) and update requirements accordingly. Use tools like Dependabot to automate dependency upgrades.

Add support for new providers: As new LLM providers emerge, implement new LLMClient subclasses and update the factory. Ensure that provider‑specific features (streaming, function calling) are supported through a unified interface.

Improve prompt templates: Continuously refine templates to achieve better responses from LLMs. Incorporate examples, context and dynamic citations. Maintain a history of template changes for reference.

Enhance concurrency strategies: Experiment with batching strategies and dynamic concurrency adjustment based on observed response times. Evaluate frameworks like Ray or Celery for distributed execution if workloads grow.

Expand documentation: Add tutorials, API references and developer guides. Encourage community contributions to documentation.

Monitor costs and performance: Track API usage and compute costs. Optimise prompts and concurrency to reduce expenses while maintaining quality.

Handoff Prompt Instructions

After the detailed devplan has been generated, a handoff prompt must instruct the roo code orchestrator mode to begin implementing the plan. The handoff prompt should:

Summarize the objective: Clearly state that the goal is to build a tool that automatically generates and updates a devplan and handoff prompt using multiple LLMs.

Reference the devplan: Inform the orchestrator where to find the detailed devplan file and instruct it to follow the numbered steps sequentially.

Maintain documentation: Instruct the orchestrator that whenever progress is made (code created, module implemented, test written) it must update the devplan document and generate corresponding documentation in docs/. Each update should include citations if applicable.

Commit at milestones: Direct the orchestrator to commit changes to the Git repository after every significant milestone (e.g., completion of each phase or a major feature). Commit messages should reflect the work done (e.g., “feat: implement LLM client” or “docs: update devplan after Phase 3”).

Create and update the handoff prompt: The handoff prompt itself should be updated whenever the user requests a handoff. It should contain instructions for the next coder, summarizing current progress, listing completed steps, identifying remaining tasks and providing links to updated docs. The orchestrator should regenerate this prompt in docs/ or a specified location.

Prompt for next handoff: At the end of the handoff instructions, include guidance that after completing a milestone or when a user indicates “it’s time for handoff,” the orchestrator should pause work, update the devplan and documentation, and generate a new handoff prompt to be passed to the next coding agent.
