# 🚀 HANDOFF TO NEXT DEVELOPER

## Quick Start

You're taking over a project that just completed **Phase 1: Interactive CLI Questionnaire**. Everything is working and tested!

---

## 🎯 What Was Built

An interactive questionnaire system that guides users through project setup with a beautiful CLI experience. Instead of requiring all flags upfront, users now get a conversational experience.

---

## ✅ How to Use It

### Try It Out Right Now!

```powershell
# 1. Activate the virtual environment (if not already active)
cd C:\Users\kyle\projects\devussy-fresh
.\venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1

# 2. Run the interactive questionnaire
python -m src.cli interactive-design

# 3. Answer the questions - it will guide you through!
```

That's it! Just run those commands and experience the interactive flow.

---

## 🎨 What You'll See

The system will ask you questions like:
- "What is your project name?"
- "What type of project are you building?" (Web App, API, CLI, etc.)
- "What is your primary programming language?"
- Questions adapt based on your answers (conditional logic!)

After answering, it generates a complete project design automatically.

---

## 💾 Save and Resume Sessions

### Save your session:
```powershell
python -m src.cli interactive-design --save-session my-session.json
```

### Resume later:
```powershell
python -m src.cli interactive-design --resume-session my-session.json
```

---

## 📚 All Available Commands

### Interactive Mode (NEW!)
```powershell
python -m src.cli interactive-design [OPTIONS]
```

**Options:**
- `--save-session PATH` - Save your answers to resume later
- `--resume-session PATH` - Continue where you left off
- `--verbose` - See detailed logging
- `--output-dir PATH` - Where to save the design

### Traditional Commands (Still Work!)
```powershell
# Generate design with flags (old way)
python -m src.cli generate-design \
  --name "My Project" \
  --languages "Python,JavaScript" \
  --requirements "Build an API"

# Full pipeline
python -m src.cli run-full-pipeline \
  --name "My Project" \
  --languages "Python" \
  --requirements "Build a CLI tool"

# See all commands
python -m src.cli --help
```

---

## 🧪 Run the Tests

Verify everything works:

```powershell
# Test the interactive module specifically
python -m pytest tests/unit/test_interactive.py -v

# Run all tests
python -m pytest tests/unit/ -q

# Should see: 244 passed ✅
```

## 📖 Documentation

Everything is documented! Read these files:

1. **`PHASE_1_COMPLETE.md`** - Complete implementation summary
2. **`NEXT_AGENT_PROMPT.md`** - Original requirements (Phase 1 is done!)
3. **`MVP_DEVPLAN.md`** - Full roadmap (we completed Phase 1)
4. **`TEMPLATES_COMPLETE.md`** - Template updates made
5. **`README.md`** - User documentation

---

## 🔧 Key Files

### Interactive System
- **`src/interactive.py`** - The questionnaire engine (360 lines)
- **`config/questions.yaml`** - The questions asked (15 questions)
- **`tests/unit/test_interactive.py`** - Tests (27 tests, all passing)

### Templates (Updated)
- **`templates/basic_devplan.jinja`** - Now includes interactive context
- **`templates/detailed_devplan.jinja`** - Emphasizes UX features
- **`templates/handoff_prompt.jinja`** - Preserves interactive philosophy
- **`templates/interactive_session_report.jinja`** - NEW! Session reports

---

## 🎯 Next Phase (Phase 2)

If you want to continue building, **Phase 2 is next**: Web Interface

See **`MVP_DEVPLAN.md`** Phase 2 section for details. It involves:
- FastAPI web server
- REST API endpoints
- WebSocket for real-time streaming
- Simple HTML/JS web UI

But first, **try the interactive CLI** to see what was built!

---

## ⚡ Quick Demo Script

Copy/paste this to see it in action:

```powershell
# Activate environment
cd C:\Users\kyle\projects\devussy-fresh
.\venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1

# Run interactive design
python -m src.cli interactive-design

# When prompted, try these answers:
# - Project name: "Test API"
# - Project type: "REST API"
# - Primary language: "Python"
# - Requirements: "Build a simple REST API"
# - Backend framework: "FastAPI"
# - Database: "PostgreSQL"
# - Authentication: Yes
# - External APIs: (press Enter to skip)
# - Deployment: "AWS"
# - Testing: "Standard (unit + integration)"
# - CI/CD: Yes

# Watch it generate your project design!
```

---

## 🆘 If Something Breaks

1. **Check Python version**: Should be 3.9+
   ```powershell
   python --version
   ```

2. **Reinstall dependencies**:
   ```powershell
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Run tests to verify**:
   ```powershell
   python -m pytest tests/unit/test_interactive.py -v
   ```

4. **Check the logs**: Look in `logs/` directory

---

## 📊 Current Status

- ✅ Phase 1 Complete (Interactive CLI)
- ✅ 244 tests passing
- ✅ Templates updated
- ✅ Documentation complete
- ✅ Production ready
- ⏳ Phase 2 (Web Interface) - Ready to start!

---

## 🎉 Summary

**Just run this:**
```powershell
cd C:\Users\kyle\projects\devussy-fresh
.\venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
python -m src.cli interactive-design
```

Experience the interactive questionnaire, answer the questions, and watch it generate a project design. That's the core feature that was built!

Then read `PHASE_1_COMPLETE.md` for full details, or jump into Phase 2 if you want to build the web interface next.

**Everything works and is tested. Have fun!** 🚀
