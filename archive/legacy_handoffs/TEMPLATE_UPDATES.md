# Template Updates for Interactive Features

## Overview

Updated DevPlan Orchestrator templates to reflect and emphasize the new interactive questionnaire approach introduced in Phase 1.

**Date:** October 19, 2025  
**Phase:** Phase 1 - Interactive CLI Questionnaire

---

## Updated Templates

### 1. `templates/basic_devplan.jinja`

**Changes:**
- Added interactive session context section that appears when a project is created via `interactive-design`
- Updated comprehensive coverage requirements to include interactive features
- Added new requirement (#5) for User Experience considerations
- Emphasizes help text, examples, and session management in interactive applications

**New Sections:**
```jinja
{% if interactive_session %}
## ðŸŽ¯ Interactive Session Context
This project was defined through an interactive guided questionnaire...
{% endif %}
```

**Impact:** Development plans now acknowledge when projects were created interactively and adapt recommendations accordingly.

---

### 2. `templates/detailed_devplan.jinja`

**Changes:**
- Added interactive context reminder at the beginning
- Updated completeness requirements to include user-facing features
- Emphasizes clear error messages, progress indicators, and help text

**New Sections:**
```jinja
{% if interactive_context %}
## ðŸŽ¯ Project Context
This project was created using an interactive questionnaire system...
{% endif %}
```

**Impact:** Detailed step-by-step plans now consider UX and provide guidance on implementing user-friendly features.

---

### 3. `templates/handoff_prompt.jinja`

**Changes:**
- Added prominent interactive session context section
- Included session file path if available
- Added new "Interactive Features" subsection in technical context
- Emphasizes maintaining the interactive philosophy throughout development

**New Sections:**
```jinja
{% if interactive_session %}
## ðŸŽ¯ Interactive Session Context
This project was created through an interactive guided questionnaire...
{% endif %}

{% if interactive_features %}
### Interactive Features
This project includes or should include interactive user experiences...
{% endif %}
```

**Impact:** Handoff prompts now preserve the context of how the project was initiated and remind developers to maintain user-friendly patterns.

---

### 4. `templates/interactive_session_report.jinja` (NEW)

**Purpose:** Generate a detailed report of an interactive session showing all questions and answers.

**Sections:**
- Session Overview (ID, timestamps, question count)
- User Responses (all Q&A pairs)
- Generated Project Profile (organized summary)
- Technology Stack
- Project Requirements
- Features & Integrations
- Deployment & Documentation
- Next Steps (commands to continue)

**Usage:**
```python
from jinja2 import Template

template = Template(open('templates/interactive_session_report.jinja').read())
report = template.render(session=interactive_session)
```

**Impact:** Provides a human-readable record of interactive sessions for documentation and future reference.

## Integration Points

### In Pipeline Code

To utilize these updated templates, the pipeline generators should pass additional context:

**For DevPlan Generation:**
```python
template_vars = {
    'project_design': design,
    'interactive_session': {
        'question_count': len(session.answers),
        'saved_session_path': session_path
    } if from_interactive else None,
    'interactive_context': True if from_interactive else False
}
```

**For Handoff Generation:**
```python
template_vars = {
    'project_name': name,
    'project_summary': summary,
    'interactive_session': session_info if from_interactive else None,
    'interactive_features': True,  # If project involves user interaction
    'architecture_notes': notes,
    'dependencies_notes': deps,
    'config_notes': config
}
```

## Benefits

1. **Context Preservation:** Templates now preserve the context of how a project was initiated
2. **Consistent Philosophy:** Encourages maintaining user-friendly patterns throughout development
3. **Better Documentation:** Generated docs reflect the interactive approach
4. **Guidance for Agents:** AI agents working on these projects get context about UX expectations
5. **Session Tracking:** New session report template provides audit trail

---

## Backward Compatibility

All template updates are **backward compatible**:
- New sections use conditional blocks (`{% if ... %}`)
- Projects not created interactively see no changes
- Existing template variables remain unchanged
- No breaking changes to existing pipeline code

---

## Future Enhancements

### Potential Additions:
1. **Question Flow Diagram:** Visual representation of which questions were asked/skipped
2. **Answer Validation Report:** Show which answers triggered conditional questions
3. **Comparison Template:** Compare multiple interactive sessions
4. **Interactive Metrics:** Track common answers, popular tech stacks, etc.

### Phase 2 Integration:
When implementing the Web Interface (Phase 2), these templates can be extended to include:
- Web session IDs
- WebSocket connection details
- Browser/client information
- Real-time generation timestamps

---

## Testing

To test the updated templates:

1. **Generate a project via interactive mode:**
   ```bash
   devussy interactive-design
   ```

2. **Check generated devplan includes interactive context:**
   Look for "ðŸŽ¯ Interactive Session Context" section

3. **Verify handoff prompt mentions interactive approach:**
   Check for interactive features guidance

4. **Generate session report:**
   Use the new `interactive_session_report.jinja` template
