## 🎓 Key Insights

### Strengths
1. **Core utilities extremely well-tested** (100% coverage)
2. **25 integration tests** provide excellent workflow coverage
3. **All tests stable** - no flaky tests, 269/269 passing
4. **Good patterns established** - easy to follow for new tests

### Gaps
1. **Pipeline generators** - core business logic undertested
2. **CLI commands** - user-facing interface needs more coverage
3. **Error scenarios** - many edge cases not tested
4. **Streaming/rate limiting** - complex features need attention

### Opportunities
1. **Follow existing patterns** from integration tests
2. **Mock LLM responses** - proven approach in place
3. **Use conftest fixtures** - shared test infrastructure ready
4. **Incremental improvement** - clear prioritization available

## 📝 Recommendations for Next Developer

### Before Starting Phase 11

**Improve test coverage to 70%+** (recommended):
- Follow the detailed plan in HANDOFF.md
- Start with pipeline generators (biggest impact)
- Use existing integration tests as examples
- Run coverage reports frequently

### Alternative: Start Phase 11 Immediately

If time-constrained, you can:
- Accept 56% coverage as baseline
- Add tests incrementally during Phase 11
- Focus on testing new features thoroughly
- Return to coverage improvement later

### Resources
- `docs/TESTING.md` - Comprehensive testing guide
- `tests/integration/` - Complex test patterns
- `tests/conftest.py` - Shared fixtures
- `HANDOFF.md` - Detailed improvement plan
