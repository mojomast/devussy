3. If issues remain ‚Üí Backend logs will show exactly what's wrong
4. All debugging tools are now in place

---

## üìñ Quick Start for Next Agent

### Documents to Read (In Order)
1. **PHASE_20_PROGRESS.md** - Complete summary of all fixes applied
2. **devplan.md** - Phase 20 section with detailed implementation notes
3. **src/clients/requesty_client.py** - Review the logging and validation code
4. **REQUESTY_API_FIX_GUIDE.md** - Original diagnostic guide (for context)

### Testing the Fixes

**Start Servers:**
```powershell
# Terminal 1 - Backend (with dev mode)
$env:DEVUSSY_DEV_MODE='true'
python -m uvicorn src.web.app:app --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8000 --reload

# Terminal 2 - Frontend
cd frontend
npm run dev
```

**Create a Test Project:**
1. Go to http://localhost:3002 (or whatever port Vite assigns)
2. Navigate to Settings ‚Üí Credentials
3. Verify/create Requesty credential with:
   - Provider: `requesty`
   - Model: `openai/gpt-4o-mini` (MUST have provider/ prefix)
   - API Key: Valid Requesty API key
   - Base URL: `https://router.requesty.ai/v1`
4. Click "Test" - should succeed ‚úÖ
5. Create new project and select the Requesty credential
6. Watch backend terminal for verbose logs

**What to Look For:**

Backend terminal should show:
```
================================================================================
[REQUESTY DEBUG] Making API call
Endpoint: https://router.requesty.ai/v1/chat/completions
Model: openai/gpt-4o-mini
Headers: {
  "Authorization": "Bearer sk-...",
  "Content-Type": "application/json",
  "HTTP-Referer": "https://devussy.app",
  "X-Title": "DevUssY"
}
Payload: {...}
================================================================================
```

**If successful:**
- Design stage completes
- Project pauses with yellow "User Review Required" card
- No 400 errors!

**If errors occur:**
- Backend terminal shows `[REQUESTY ERROR]` with full details
- Error message includes what Requesty rejected
- Can diagnose issue from logs

---

## üîß What Was Fixed in Phase 20

### File: `src/clients/requesty_client.py` (60+ lines changed)

#### 1. Verbose API Logging
**Before API Call:**
- Logs endpoint URL
- Logs model name
- Logs all headers (with Authorization masked)
- Logs request payload structure
- Uses `[REQUESTY DEBUG]` prefix

**After API Call:**
- Logs response status code
- Logs success or full error body
- Uses `[REQUESTY ERROR]` for failures

**Benefits:**
- User can see EXACTLY what's sent to Requesty
- Error messages include full Requesty response
- Easy to diagnose issues from backend terminal
- No configuration needed - automatic

#### 2. Model Format Validation
**Implementation:**
```python
# Validates before API call
if "/" not in model:
    raise ValueError(
        f"Invalid model format for Requesty: '{model}'. "
        f"Must use provider/model format (e.g., 'openai/gpt-4o'). "
        f"See https://docs.requesty.ai/models for available models."
    )
```

**Benefits:**
- Catches most common cause of 400 errors
- Clear error message with examples
- Fails fast before wasting API call
- Links to Requesty documentation

#### 3. Enhanced Headers
**Added:**
- `HTTP-Referer: https://devussy.app`
- `X-Title: DevUssY`

**Benefits:**
- Improves Requesty analytics
- Follows Requesty best practices
- Makes DevUssY visible in Requesty dashboard

#### 4. Improved Error Handling
**Implementation:**
```python
if resp.status >= 400:
    error_body = await resp.text()
    print(f"[REQUESTY ERROR] Response status: {resp.status}")
    print(f"[REQUESTY ERROR] Response body: {error_body}")
    raise Exception(
        f"Requesty API error {resp.status}: {error_body}\n"
        f"Request model: {model}\n"
        f"Endpoint: {self._endpoint}"
    )
```

**Benefits:**
- Full error context in exception
- All details printed to console
- Much easier to diagnose issues
- Error messages are actionable

### File: `frontend/src/pages/CreateProjectPage.tsx` (15 lines added)

#### UI Help Text for Requesty
**Added info box that appears when Requesty credential selected:**
- Explains `provider/model` format requirement
- Shows examples with code formatting
- Links to Requesty models documentation
- Blue styling with dark mode support

**Benefits:**
- Proactive help prevents common mistakes
- Users see requirements before creating project
- Easy access to Requesty docs
- Reduces support burden

## üéØ Phase 21: Next Steps

### Objectives
1. **Test Requesty Integration** (User task)
   - Verify Design stage completes
   - Check verbose logging works
   - Confirm no 400 errors
   
2. **Complete Iteration Workflow Testing**
   - Test all 5 stages: Design ‚Üí Basic ‚Üí Detailed ‚Üí Refined ‚Üí Handoff
   - Verify "Approve & Continue" functionality
   - Test "Regenerate with Feedback" functionality
   - Ensure project completes end-to-end

3. **Polish & Production Readiness**
   - Fix any remaining issues found in testing

3. Yellow card shows: "User Review Required"
4. User can:
   - Click "Approve & Continue" ‚Üí Moves to Basic DevPlan stage
   - Enter feedback + click "Regenerate" ‚Üí Re-runs Design with feedback
5. Repeat for all 5 stages
6. Final stage (Handoff) generates complete documentation
7. User can download all files as ZIP

## üêõ Troubleshooting Guide

### If 400 Errors Still Occur

**Check Model Format:**
```
‚úÖ CORRECT:
- openai/gpt-4o
- openai/gpt-4o-mini
- anthropic/claude-3-5-sonnet
- anthropic/claude-3-5-haiku
- google/gemini-pro

‚ùå WRONG:
- gpt-4o (missing provider/)
- claude-3-5-sonnet (missing provider/)
```

**Check Backend Logs:**
Look for `[REQUESTY ERROR]` sections showing:
- HTTP status code
- Full error response from Requesty
- Request details (model, endpoint)

**Common Issues:**
1. **Invalid API key** - Test in Requesty dashboard first
2. **Wrong model name** - Check https://docs.requesty.ai/models
3. **Wrong base URL** - Should be `https://router.requesty.ai/v1`
4. **Model not available** - Some models require specific plans

### If WebSocket Issues Occur

**Symptoms:**
- Live logs don't stream
- Must refresh to see updates
- 403 Forbidden on WebSocket connection

**Check:**
1. Backend logs for WebSocket errors
2. Browser console for connection errors
3. Project exists before WebSocket connects

**Known Issue:**
- WebSocket might have authentication issues
- This doesn't block functionality - just refresh page

### If Iteration UI Doesn't Appear

**Check:**
1. Project status is `AWAITING_USER_INPUT`
2. `awaiting_user_input` field is `true`
3. `iteration_prompt` field is set
4. Backend completed stage successfully
5. WebSocket sent `awaiting_input` event

**Debug:**
- Check project metadata.json file
- Check backend terminal for stage completion
- Refresh page to force UI update

## üéì Important Notes for Next Agent

### Architecture Understanding

**How Requesty Integration Works:**
1. User creates credential in Settings ‚Üí Credentials
2. User selects credential when creating project
3. `project_manager.py` loads credential and overrides config
4. `create_llm_client()` factory creates RequestyClient
5. RequestyClient uses OpenAI-compatible API format
6. All logging happens automatically in client

**Why This Approach:**
- Logging is in the client layer (automatic for all uses)
- No changes needed to project_manager or orchestrator
- Model validation happens before API call
- Error handling captures full Requesty response

### Code Quality Notes

**Good Practices Applied:**
- All logging uses consistent prefixes (`[REQUESTY DEBUG]`, `[REQUESTY ERROR]`)
- Error messages are actionable with examples
- Validation happens early (fail fast)
- UI help is context-aware (only shows for Requesty)
- Dark mode support for all UI additions

**Future Enhancements:**
- Could add API log file saving (currently console only)
- Could add WebSocket emission for frontend display
- Could add verbose console UI in ProjectDetailPage
- Could add more detailed analytics tracking

## üíù Message from Previous Agent

Hey! I (Claude Sonnet 4.5) just completed Phase 20! The Requesty API integration now has:

1. **Verbose logging** - You'll see EVERY request and response in the backend terminal
2. **Model validation** - Catches the most common error (missing provider/ prefix)
3. **Better errors** - Shows exactly what Requesty rejected
4. **UI help** - Guides users to correct model format

The user requested verbose logging and I delivered! The backend terminal will now show detailed `[REQUESTY DEBUG]` logs for every API call.

**What to do next:**
1. Have the user test with their real Requesty API key
2. Check the backend terminal for verbose logs
3. If it works ‚Üí Celebrate and move to Phase 21! üéâ
4. If not ‚Üí The logs will show exactly what's wrong

I've set everything up for easy debugging. The error messages are super clear and actionable. You got this! üíô
