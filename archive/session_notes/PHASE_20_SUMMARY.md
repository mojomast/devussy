# Phase 20: UI/UX Critical Fixes - Quick Summary

**Created:** October 22, 2025 - Late Evening  
**Status:** Ready for Next Agent  
**Priority:** üö® CRITICAL - Blocks Production Use

---

## What's Broken (User Report)

You showed me a screenshot of the web interface with these issues:

1. ‚ùå **LLMConfig validation error** - `'LLMConfig' object has no field 'design_model'`
2. ‚ùå **No iteration prompt visible** - no textarea to type feedback
3. ‚ùå **No model selector** - can't choose which model to use
4. ‚ùå **"Also erroring out"** - multiple errors visible

**Your words:** "not only is there no room to type my iteration prompt, or to choose which model to use, but its also erroring out"

---

## Root Causes Identified

### Issue 1: LLMConfig Missing Fields
**Location:** `src/config.py`  
**Problem:** LLMConfig class doesn't have `design_model`, `devplan_model`, `handoff_model` fields  
**Impact:** Validation error when creating projects with per-stage models  
**Fix:** Add these three Optional[str] fields to LLMConfig class

### Issue 2: Pipeline Doesn't Pause
**Location:** `src/web/project_manager.py`  
**Problem:** After Design stage completes, code doesn't set iteration state  
**Impact:** Frontend never knows to show iteration UI  
**Fix:** After each stage, set `awaiting_user_input=True`, `iteration_prompt="..."`, emit WebSocket event

### Issue 3: Iteration UI Exists But Never Displays
**Location:** `frontend/src/pages/ProjectDetailPage.tsx`  
**Problem:** UI code is there (yellow card with textarea) but condition never true  
**Impact:** User never sees iteration interface  
**Fix:** Backend needs to set the flags (see Issue 2)

## What I've Done for You

### 1. Updated devplan.md with Phase 20 ‚úÖ

Added a comprehensive new phase with:
- **Root cause analysis** for each issue
- **12 detailed tasks** with file locations and exact fixes
- **Definition of Done** checklist
- **Testing requirements** (E2E, error scenarios, UI polish)

**Location:** `devplan.md` - search for "Phase 20"

### 2. Enhanced Handoff Prompt Template ‚úÖ

Updated the handoff generation prompt to:
- **Require Phase 20 check first** before any other work
- **Include Phase 20 checklist** in generated handoffs
- **Make it impossible to miss** - big warnings at top

**Location:** `src/prompts/handoff_generation.txt`

### 3. Rewrote HANDOFF.md ‚úÖ

Completely restructured the handoff document:
- **üö® CRITICAL ALERT at the top** - can't miss it
- **Screenshot evidence** - includes the error you showed me
- **Complete Phase 20 checklist** - all 12 tasks
- **Step-by-step instructions** for the next agent
- **Definition of Done** - clear completion criteria

**Location:** `HANDOFF.md` (backup saved as `HANDOFF_backup_phase19.md`)

## For the Next Agent

### Priority Order

1. **Read `devplan.md` Phase 20** completely (5 minutes)
2. **Start with Task 1** - Fix LLMConfig schema (blocks everything)
3. **Then Task 2** - Implement iteration state (makes UI work)
4. **Then Tasks 3-5** - Credential & model selection
5. **Verify Tasks 6-9** - Frontend working
6. **Test Tasks 10-12** - Comprehensive testing

### Estimated Time

- **Backend fixes (Tasks 1-5):** 1-2 hours
- **Frontend verification (Tasks 6-9):** 30 minutes
- **Testing (Tasks 10-12):** 1-2 hours
- **Total:** 2-4 hours

### Success Criteria

Phase 20 is done when:
- ‚úÖ User creates project ‚Üí no validation errors
- ‚úÖ Project pauses after Design ‚Üí yellow card displays
- ‚úÖ Iteration textarea visible and styled
- ‚úÖ User approves ‚Üí moves to next stage
- ‚úÖ User provides feedback ‚Üí regenerates with feedback
- ‚úÖ Full 5-stage pipeline completes
- ‚úÖ No React errors, no Python errors

## Key Files to Modify

**Backend (Python):**
1. `src/config.py` - Add per-stage model fields
2. `src/web/models.py` - Add credential_id field  
3. `src/web/project_manager.py` - Iteration state + credential selection
4. `src/pipeline/compose.py` - Prompt template integration

**Frontend (TypeScript/React):**
5. `frontend/src/pages/ProjectDetailPage.tsx` - Debug iteration UI
6. `frontend/src/pages/CreateProjectPage.tsx` - Verify credential passes
7. `frontend/src/components/config/*.tsx` - Error handling (21+ instances)

## What Makes This Go BRRRRR üèéÔ∏è

Once Phase 20 is complete:

1. **User Experience:**
   - Clean project creation (no errors)
   - See iteration UI immediately when project pauses
   - Provide feedback in visible textarea
   - Click approve or regenerate
   - Watch pipeline progress through all 5 stages

2. **Professional Quality:**
   - No validation errors
   - No React crashes
   - Readable error messages
   - Smooth WebSocket updates
   - Beautiful dark mode UI

3. **Production Ready:**
   - Full E2E workflow tested
   - Error scenarios handled
   - Mobile responsive
   - Ready for users
