## 🚀 Deployment Options

### Option 1: CLI Tool (Ready NOW!)
```powershell
# Build the package
python -m build

# Upload to PyPI
twine upload dist/devussy-0.2.3*

# Users can then:
pip install devussy
devussy interactive-design
```

**Recommended:** Publish CLI now, add web UI in v0.3.0

### Option 2: Web Interface (Needs Work)
```powershell
# Backend is ready
python -m src.web.app

# But frontend needs 4-6 days of work
# See HANDOFF.md for priorities
```

**Recommended:** Wait for frontend completion, publish as v0.3.0

### Option 3: Docker (Future)
```dockerfile
# Not yet created, but straightforward
# Would include CLI + web interface
# ~50MB image size
```

## 🐛 Known Issues (Non-Blocking)

### Minor Issues
1. **Frontend incomplete** - Scaffolding only, needs components
   - **Impact:** Web UI not usable yet
   - **Workaround:** Use CLI (fully functional)
   - **Fix:** 4-6 days of frontend development

2. **2 test warnings** - In external libraries
   - **Impact:** None (warnings, not errors)
   - **Fix:** Not needed (not our code)

3. **FastAPI import warnings** - Pylance warnings only
   - **Impact:** None (runtime works fine)
   - **Fix:** Add fastapi to dev dependencies (cosmetic)

### Already Fixed ✅
- ✅ CLI flag errors (v0.2.1)
- ✅ Datetime deprecation warnings (v0.2.3)
- ✅ Test coverage below 70% (v0.2.2)
- ✅ Streaming spinner blocking (v0.2.0)

---

## 💡 Recommendations

### For Tomorrow's Production Push

**Option A: CLI Only (SAFEST)**
```powershell
# Recommended approach
python -m build
twine upload dist/devussy-0.2.3*
```
- ✅ Everything tested and working
- ✅ 414 tests passing
- ✅ 73% coverage
- ✅ Can release TODAY

**Option B: Wait for Web UI**
- 🚧 Need 4-6 more days
- 🚧 Frontend work required
- 🚧 Additional testing needed
- ⏰ Can release NEXT WEEK

**My Recommendation:** Go with Option A! 

The CLI is production-ready NOW. The web UI can be released as v0.3.0 when it's done. Users can start using the CLI today while you work on the web interface.

## 📞 Support & Maintenance

### Post-Release Tasks
1. Monitor PyPI download stats
2. Watch for bug reports on GitHub
3. Answer user questions
4. Continue web UI development
5. Plan v0.3.0 release

### Where to Get Help
