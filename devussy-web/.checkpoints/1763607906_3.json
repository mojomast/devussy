High-Level Project Objectives  \n2. Technology Stack Recommendations  \n3. Architecture Overview  \n4. Key Dependencies  \n5. Project Structure  \n6. Potential Challenges and Mitigations  \n7. Development Approach\n\n---\n\n## 1. High-Level Project Objectives\n\n### Purpose and primary goal\n- Build a single-player, turn-based, terminal-playable roguelite inspired by Pac\u2011Man:\n  - Player navigates procedurally generated mazes, eats tokens, avoids enemies, gains XP, levels up, finds loot and skills.\n  - Runs contribute persistent meta-progression points that can be spent on permanent upgrades between runs.\n- Deliver a polished, fun, replayable game playable entirely in a terminal.\n\n### Problems it solves / value proposition\n- Provides a lightweight, accessible roguelite experience that runs in a terminal (low system requirements).\n- Demonstrates good procedural generation, enemy AI, and a simple persistent progression system in an approachable codebase.\n- Offers a small, well-structured project for learning game programming, algorithms (mazes, A*), and architecture in Python.\n\n### Target user / audience\n- Terminal users who enjoy roguelikes/roguelites and quick runs.\n- Developers learning game mechanics and procedural generation.\n- Players who prefer keyboard-only, text/ASCII art aesthetics.\n\n### Key success criteria (measurable)\n- Core loop implemented: map generation, token collection, enemy behavior, XP/leveling, loot/skills, run termination.\n- Playability: run from start to finish without crashes; maps fit typical terminal sizes (>= 80x24).\n- Persistence: points earned persist between runs and can be spent in a meta menu.\n- Performance: turn response < 100ms on typical development machine for maps up to 120x40.\n- Test coverage: critical game logic (map gen, pathfinding, combat, persistence) covered by unit tests.\n- Developer ergonomics: developer can start running the game and tests with 2 commands (e.g., install + run or just `poetry install && poetry run token-muncher`).\n\n---\n\n## 2. Technology Stack Recommendations\n\nPrimary language: Python (as specified)\n\nRecommended libraries/tools (with justification):\n\n1. Terminal Rendering & Input\n   - Primary option: `tcod` (libtcod bindings via python-tcod)\n     - Why: Battle-tested in roguelike dev; provides console rendering, input handling, FOV, pathfinding, and good examples.\n     - Pros: Fast, feature-rich, suited for ASCII/terminal games.\n     - Cons: Adds a C binding dependency; slightly heavier than pure Python.\n   - Lightweight alternative: `rich` + `readchar`\n     - Why: `rich` provides colored text, high-quality terminal control; `readchar` simplifies single-key input.\n     - Best when you want minimal native dependencies; slightly more work for rendering grids.\n   - Cross-platform note: `curses` is an option but less ergonomic and inconsistent on Windows unless `windows-curses` is added.\n\n2. Game architecture & utilities\n   - `dataclasses` (builtin) & `typing`: structured data, type hints for maintainability.\n   - `attrs` (optional): if you prefer richer dataclass features.\n   - `pydantic` (optional): if you need validation for complex persisted data.\n\n3.

Prefer builtin or lightweight dependencies for simple persistence. Use standard Python tooling to maintain code quality and reproducibility.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Architecture Overview\n\nOverall approach: Layered architecture with a central, testable game model (engine + systems) and thin platform-specific I/O (terminal renderer + input). Use an event-driven core (EventBus) to keep systems decoupled.\n\nTop-level components:\n- Game Engine / Loop\n- Game Model (world state)\n- Entities & Component System (lightweight)\n- Systems (Movement, AI, Combat, Loot, XP/Leveling, Spawn, Persistence)\n- Renderer (terminal view)\n- Input Controller\n- Persistence Manager (saves meta-progression)\n- EventBus / Message System\n- Configuration & Resources (game constants, tiers, loot tables)\n\nPattern decisions:\n- MVC-ish: Model = game state & systems; View = Renderer; Controller = Input handler. Use EventBus to mediate events (turns, death, item pickup).\n- ECS-like but minimal: Entities are dataclasses with components expressed as attributes rather than full-blown ECS library \u2014 aim for simplicity and testability.\n\nComponent responsibilities\n- Game Engine\n  - Maintain main loop (turn-based).\n  - Coordinate player turn vs enemy turns.\n  - Emit events (TurnStart, ActionPerformed, EntityDied).\n- Game Model\n  - Maze map + tile types, items, tokens.\n  - Entity list with positions and attributes (HP, speed, inventory, XP).\n  - Random seed / RNG state for reproducibility.\n- Systems\n  - MovementSystem: validation, collision checks, token pickups.\n  - AISystem: enemy behavior (chase, scatter, flee, random walk).\n  - CombatSystem: resolve damage and deaths.\n  - LootSystem: generate and apply loot/skills.\n  - XPSystem: reward XP, handle level-ups.\n  - MetaSystem: track earned points and apply persistent upgrades between runs.\n- Renderer\n  - Draw map and entities to terminal; show HUD (HP, XP, level, tokens, run points).\n  - Support different rendering backends (adapter pattern) so unit tests can mock rendering.\n- Input Controller\n  - Read keystrokes -> translate to commands (move, wait, use skill, open shop, exit).\n- Persistence Manager\n  - Read/write persistent meta state (points, unlocks).\n  - Save run logs (optional).\n- EventBus\n  - Publish/subscribe simple event objects so systems can react without tight coupling.\n\nData & Control Flow (high-level)\n- Player issues action via Input -> Controller transforms to Action -> Engine validates & sends to relevant Systems -> Systems update Model -> Systems publish Events (pickup, kill) -> Renderer subscribes to Events to animate/flash -> Engine advances enemy turns -> Repeat until run end -> Persistence Manager stores points.\n\nASCII/mermaid diagrams\n\nMermaid (flow):\n```mermaid\nflowchart LR\n  Input -->|Command| Engine\n  Engine --> Model\n  Engine --> Systems\n  Systems --> Model\n  Systems --> EventBus\n  EventBus --> Renderer\n  Renderer --> Terminal\n  Engine --> Persistence\n```\n\nSimple ASCII sequence:\n- [User Input] -> [Controller] -> [Engine] -> [MovementSystem / AISystem / CombatSystem] -> [Model updated] -> [EventBus] -> [Renderer] -> [Terminal]\n\nTurn flow pseudocode:\n```python\nwhile game_running:\n    action = controller.get_player_action()\n    engine.process(action)  # validate, resolve collisions, pickups, combat\n    for enemy in enemies:\n        ai_action = ai_system.decide(enemy, model)\n        engine.process(ai_action)\n    engine.resolve_end_of_turn()\n    renderer.render(model)\n```\n\nState determinism:\n- Engine carries RNG seed per run; seed saved for replayability.\n\n---\n\n## 4. Key Dependencies\n\nRecommended critical dependencies and alternatives:\n\n1. python-tcod (tcod)\n   - Why: terminal rendering, input, pathfinding, FOV utilities for grid games.\n   - Risks: C-bindings complexity; installation on some platforms may require build tools.\n   - Alternative: rich + readchar or curses (with windows-curses on Windows).\n\n2. pytest\n   - Why: essential for unit/integration tests and for CI.\n   - Risks: none significant.\n   - Alternative: unittest (builtin), but pytest is more productive.\n\n3. poetry\n   - Why: dependency and packaging management.\n   - Risks: learning curve for new contributors; alternative pip + venv works.\n\n4. mypy, black, ruff\n   - Why: static typing and consistent style.\n   - Risks: developer friction if rules are too strict; configurable.\n\n5. sqlite3 (builtin) or JSON files\n   - Why: persistence for meta-progression.\n   - Risks: accidental corruption; ensure atomic writes and backups.\n\n6. readchar (if not using tcod)\n   - Why: simple char input cross-platform.\n   - Risks: minor.\n\n7. Optional: pytest-xdist for parallel testing\n   - Why: speed CI for larger test suites.\n\nDependency risk mitigation:\n- Lock dependencies (poetry.lock).\n- Provide easy install instructions and Docker dev container for reproducibility.\n- Offer alternatives in README (how to run without tcod).\n- Keep core game logic independent of the rendering library to reduce coupling.\n\n---\n\n## 5.

Keeps code importable in editable installs.\n- model/: map, entity definitions, and pure state. No I/O here.\n- systems/: pure game logic that operates on model. Testable and independent of renderer/i/o.\n- renderer/: abstract base and specific implementations. The rest of the code depends on the base interface.\n- input/: keyboard input handling; separate adapter for test mocks.\n- persistence/: saving/loading meta-progression and runtime settings.\n- utils/: algorithms like A*, RNG helpers.\n- tests/: unit (model and systems), integration (engine + renderer in headless mode).\n- docs/: game design docs, loot tables, balancing notes.\n- scripts/: helper scripts for dev, packaging.\n\nCode organization best practices:\n- Keep side-effecting code out of module import time. main.py should be entrypoint.\n- Keep pure logic decoupled from rendering; pass state objects or use an interface.\n- Favor small, single-responsibility modules.\n- Use type hints and docstrings.\n\nExample minimal entrypoint (src/token_muncher/main.py):\n```python\ndef main():\n    config = load_config()\n    persistence = MetaStore(config.meta_path)\n    renderer = get_renderer(config)\n    controller = KeyboardController()\n    engine = Engine(config, persistence)\n    engine.run(renderer, controller)\n```\n\nTesting conventions:\n- Unit tests for map generation, pathfinding, item pickup, XP logic, persistence serialization.\n- Integration tests for a few deterministic seeds that run 10-50 turns and assert invariants.\n\n---\n\n## 6. Potential Challenges and Mitigations\n\n1. Terminal compatibility (Windows vs Unix)\n   - Risks: curses/terminal features behave differently; tcod dependency may be tricky on Windows.\n   - Mitigations:\n     - Provide alternative renderer (text-only using print/ANSI) and test on Windows.\n     - Document dependencies and Windows install steps (e.g., `pip install windows-curses`).\n     - Use CI matrix to test on Linux + Windows runners.\n\n2. Rendering/performance bottlenecks\n   - Risks: large maps + many entities may slow down rendering and turn resolution.\n   - Mitigations:\n     - Optimize renderer drawing: only redraw changed tiles (dirty rectangles) instead of full screen.\n     - Keep map sizes reasonable by design defaults (e.g., 80x24 to 120x40).\n     - Profile critical loops; use list comprehensions and avoid excessive object allocations.\n     - Use tcod which uses efficient console blitting.\n\n3. Procedural generation quality (too noisy / hard to navigate)\n   - Risks: generated maps that are confusing or unfair.\n   - Mitigations:\n     - Use robust maze algorithms (recursive backtracker or Prim\u2019s), then apply smoothing to ensure clear corridors and token placement.\n     - Generate multiple candidate maps and evaluate metrics (path lengths, connectivity, token density) to select the best.\n     - Provide seed-based reproducibility for testing.\n\n4. Enemy AI complexity / fairness\n   - Risks: enemies that trap player unfairly or are predictable/boring.\n   - Mitigations:\n     - Implement simple finite-state machines per enemy (chase, scatter, patrol, frightened).\n     - Use pathfinding with distance-based heuristics, and allow randomness in behavior.\n     - Add difficulty scaling, and test enemy interactions in unit tests.\n\n5. Balancing XP, loot, meta progression\n   - Risks: progression feels meaningless or breaks game balance.\n   - Mitigations:\n     - Start with simple numerical systems and instrument metrics (average run length, tokens collected).\n     - Implement tweakable JSON/YAML config tables for loot/XP to iterate without code changes.\n     - Introduce analytics logs (local only) for later analysis.\n\n6. Persistence integrity and upgrades\n   - Risks: save corruption or incompatible versions.\n   - Mitigations:\n     - Use schema versioning in saved data.\n     - Write saves atomically (write-temp + rename).\n     - Provide a migration path for saved meta data.\n\n7. Testability with terminal I/O\n   - Risks: renderer/input make integration tests brittle.\n   - Mitigations:\n     - Provide headless renderer and mock input for tests.\n     - Keep logic in systems that can be exercised without the renderer.\n\n8. Scope creep\n   - Risks: adding features that overcomplicate the first release.\n   - Mitigations:\n     - Define a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) and prioritize core loop; postpone fancy features (achievements, multiple characters) to post-MVP.\n     - Use a backlog and small iterations.\n\nSecurity considerations:\n- Local application; minimal external attack surface.\n- If saving remote stats in future, ensure secure transport and validate inputs.\n- Sanitize any file paths; avoid executing untrusted code.\n\n---\n\n## 7. Development Approach\n\nRecommended methodology\n- Agile / Iterative with short sprints (1\u20132 weeks).\n- Start with an MVP scope focused on a playable single-run loop and basic persistence.\n- Keep issues small & actionable; use a kanban board or GitHub Projects.\n\nSuggested milestones\n1. MVP (2\u20134 weeks)\n   - Minimal dev environment, CI, and packaging.\n   - Map generation, player movement, token pickups, basic renderer, input handling, engine loop.\n2. Enemies & AI (1\u20132 weeks)\n   - Enemy entities, basic chase behavior, collisions and death.\n3. XP/Leveling & Loot (1\u20132 weeks)\n   - XP rewards, simple skills, loot drops.\n4. Persistence & Meta (1 week)\n   - Points earned and persistent upgrades between runs.\n5. Polish & Balancing (1\u20132 weeks)\n   - HUD, sound/notifications (beeps), config tuning, test coverage.\n6. Release prep\n   - Packaging, docs, and user guide.\n\nTesting strategy\n- Unit tests:\n  - Map generation properties (connectivity), A* pathfinding correctness, systems (XP, loot), persistence serialization.\n- Integration tests:\n  - Headless run of engine with deterministic seed for a fixed number of turns to ensure no exceptions and invariant properties.\n- End-to-end (manual):\n  - Playtesting sessions on major platforms (Linux, macOS, Windows) and record issues.\n- Test tooling:\n  - pytest with fixtures for deterministic RNG seeds.\n  - Use mocks for renderer and input.\n\nTDD / style:\n- Recommend TDD for critical logic (map gen, pathfinding, combat).\n- Use pre-commit hooks with black and ruff to keep codebase consistent.\n\nCI/CD\n- GitHub Actions workflow:\n  - On push / PR: install dependencies, run linters, mypy, run pytest.\n  - On tag/release: build wheel (poetry build) and optionally publish to PyPI or upload release artifact.\n- Release cadence:\n  - Use semantic versioning (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH).\n  - Keep changelog updated with notable changes.\n\nDocumentation\n- README with quick start, controls, and dev setup.\n- docs/design.md with game rules, number values, and procedural generation explanation.\n- Inline docstrings and type hints for maintainability.\n- CONTRIBUTORS / CONTRIBUTING guide with style and how to run tests locally.\n- Add a simple playtest checklist and known issues file.\n\nExample developer commands\n- Install & run:\n  - With poetry: `poetry install && poetry run token-muncher`\n- Run tests:\n  - `poetry run pytest`\n- Lint:\n  - `poetry run ruff check src tests && poetry run black --check .`\n\n---\n\n## Appendices\n\n### Example entity dataclass\n```python\nfrom dataclasses import dataclass\n\n@dataclass\nclass Entity:\n    id: int\n    name: str\n    x: int\n    y: int\n    hp: int\n    max_hp: int\n    speed: int\n    is_player: bool = False\n    inventory: list = None\n```\n\n### Minimal A* API (utils/a_star.py)\n- `find_path(grid, start, goal, passable_fn)` -> list[(x,y)] or None\n- Include unit tests for diagonal vs orthogonal moves and obstacles.\n\n### Suggested default game config (config.py)\n- Map size: width=80, height=24\n- Token count per map: function of area (e.g., area * 0.04)\n- Enemy count: 2\u20135 depending on difficulty\n- XP per token: 1\n- XP to level: level^2 * base_xp\n\n---\n\nIf you\u2019d like, I can:\n- Produce a prioritized backlog (user stories + estimates).\n- Provide concrete MVP tasks with time estimates for a solo developer.\n- Draft sample code for the engine loop, map generator, or A* pathfinding."
