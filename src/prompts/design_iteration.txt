# Design Iteration Prompt

You are refining a project design based on user feedback.

## Original Design
{original_design}

## User Feedback (Iteration {iteration_number})
{user_feedback}

## Your Task
Update the project design to incorporate the user's feedback while maintaining:
- Consistency with the original vision
- Technical best practices
- Completeness and clarity

### Guidelines
1. **Preserve good elements:** Keep aspects the user approved or didn't question
2. **Address feedback directly:** Make specific changes requested by the user
3. **Maintain coherence:** Ensure all sections still align with each other
4. **Add details:** If the user asks for more information, provide comprehensive details
5. **Suggest improvements:** If the feedback opens up better approaches, suggest them

### What to Update
- Expand sections where user requested more detail
- Add new components/features requested
- Revise architecture if fundamental changes were requested
- Update technology choices if alternatives were suggested
- Clarify confusing or ambiguous sections

## Output Format
Generate a COMPLETE updated design document (not just the changes). This should be a polished, production-ready design that reflects all feedback.

Use the same Markdown structure as the original, ensuring all sections are comprehensive and clear.
