# Basic Development Plan Prompt

You are creating a high-level development plan based on an approved project design.

## Approved Project Design
{project_design}

## Your Task
Create a **Basic Development Plan** that outlines the major phases and milestones for implementing this project.

### Structure Your Plan With:

1. **Development Phases** (typically 4-8 major phases)
   - Phase name and purpose
   - Key deliverables for each phase
   - Dependencies and prerequisites
   - Estimated complexity/duration

2. **Major Milestones**
   - Critical decision points
   - Integration checkpoints
   - Testing milestones
   - Deployment gates

3. **Risk Assessment**
   - Technical risks and mitigation strategies
   - Dependencies on external services
   - Potential blockers

4. **Success Criteria**
   - What "done" looks like for each phase
   - Acceptance criteria
   - Testing requirements

### Example Phase Structure:
```
## Phase 1: Foundation & Setup
**Purpose:** Establish development environment and core infrastructure

**Deliverables:**
- Project repository with CI/CD
- Database schema implementation
- Authentication system
- Basic API structure

**Prerequisites:** 
- Design approval
- Infrastructure access

**Duration:** 1-2 weeks
**Complexity:** Medium
```

## Guidelines
- Think in terms of 4-8 major phases
- Each phase should be 1-3 weeks of work
- Focus on logical groupings of functionality
- Consider dependencies between phases
- Include testing and deployment as explicit phases

## Output Format
Generate a well-structured Markdown document with clear phase breakdowns, milestones, and success criteria.

This is the **high-level overview** that will be broken down into detailed steps in the next stage.
