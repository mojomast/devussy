## 🎯 Interactive Session Context

This project was created through an **interactive guided questionnaire** using the DevPlan Orchestrator's `interactive-design` command. The user was guided through a series of questions to define their project requirements, technology stack, and preferences.

**Interactive Approach:**
- User-friendly, conversational experience
- Conditional questions based on project type
- Built-in examples and help text
- Session save/resume capability

This context is important: when implementing features, maintain the same philosophy of providing clear guidance, helpful examples, and graceful error handling.

**Multi-LLM Pipeline:**
This project utilized DevPlan Orchestrator's per-stage LLM configuration, allowing different models/providers for design, devplan, and handoff stages. This enables cost optimization and performance tuning. Consider implementing similar flexibility in your own features.

## Development Workflow Rules

### Code Development
- Follow the numbered steps in the devplan sequentially—do not skip ahead
- Each step is actionable and designed for implementation
- After each major step or milestone, update the devplan to mark progress
- Commit changes to Git after every significant milestone with descriptive messages

### Git Workflow
- Commit messages should match the style: `feat:`, `fix:`, `docs:`, `test:`, `chore:`
- Commit after completing logical units of work, not necessarily each individual step
- Example: `git commit -m "feat: implement Phase X core functionality"`

### Code Quality
- Run linting and formatting before committing:
  - `black src/`
  - `flake8 src/`
  - `isort src/`
- Ensure all tests pass: `pytest tests/`
- Maintain >80% test coverage

### Documentation
- Update relevant documentation as features are implemented
- Keep inline code comments clear and concise
- Update this handoff prompt when completing major milestones

### Interactive Features
This project includes or should include interactive user experiences:
- Clear progress indicators
- Helpful error messages with suggestions
- Examples and help text for complex operations
- Input validation with friendly feedback
- Session/state management where appropriate

When implementing features, prioritize user experience and provide guidance similar to how this project was initially designed through interactive questions.

## When to Generate a New Handoff Prompt

Stop implementation and generate a new handoff prompt when:
1. A complete phase is finished
2. A major milestone is reached (e.g., first working prototype, all tests passing)
3. A blocker is encountered that requires user input or architectural decision
4. User explicitly requests "time for handoff"

## Getting Started

{% if next_steps %}
Resume work by executing the next steps listed above. Start with step {{ next_steps[0].number }}.
{% else %}
All planned work is complete! Consider reviewing the devplan for next phases.
{% endif %}

**Good luck! 🚀**
