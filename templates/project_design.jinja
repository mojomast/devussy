You are an expert software architect and project planner. A developer is starting a new project and needs a comprehensive project design document.

## Project Information

**Project Name:** {{ project_name }}
**Primary Languages:** {{ languages | join(", ") }}
**Frameworks:** {{ frameworks | join(", ") if frameworks else "None specified" }}
**External APIs/Services:** {{ apis | join(", ") if apis else "None specified" }}
**Additional Requirements:** {{ requirements }}

{% if database %}
**Database:** {{ database }}
{% endif %}

{% if deployment_platform %}
**Deployment Platform:** {{ deployment_platform }}
{% endif %}

{% if testing_requirements %}
**Testing Requirements:** {{ testing_requirements }}
{% endif %}

{% if authentication %}
**Authentication Required:** Yes
{% endif %}

{% if user_emphasis %}
## Critical User Requirements (Verbatim)

The user explicitly emphasized the following points as important. These MUST be addressed in the design:

{% for emphasis in user_emphasis %}
- "{{ emphasis }}"
{% endfor %}
{% endif %}

## Your Task

Create a comprehensive project design document that includes the following sections. Be specific, detailed, and actionable.

{% if user_emphasis %}
**IMPORTANT**: Pay special attention to the "Critical User Requirements" section above. These are exact quotes from the user about what they consider most important for this project. Ensure your design explicitly addresses each of these points.

### 1. High-Level Project Objectives
- What is the primary purpose and goal of this project?
- What problems does it solve?
- Who is the target user or audience?
- What are the key success criteria?

### 2. Technology Stack Recommendations
- Evaluate the specified languages and frameworks
- Recommend additional libraries, tools, or frameworks that would be beneficial
- Justify each major technology choice
- Consider factors like: scalability, maintainability, developer experience, community support

### 3. Architecture Overview
- Describe the overall system architecture
- Identify major components and their responsibilities
- Explain how components interact with each other
- Consider patterns: MVC, microservices, event-driven, layered architecture, etc.
- Include data flow and control flow descriptions

### 4. Key Dependencies
- List all critical external dependencies (libraries, APIs, services)
- Explain why each dependency is necessary
- Assess risks associated with each dependency
- Suggest alternatives where applicable

### 5. Project Structure
- Recommend a directory/file structure
- Explain the organization of code, tests, documentation, configuration
- Consider best practices for the chosen technology stack

### 6. Potential Challenges and Mitigations
- Identify technical challenges or risks
- Suggest mitigation strategies for each challenge
- Consider: performance bottlenecks, security concerns, scalability issues, integration complexity

### 7. Development Approach
- Recommend development methodology (agile, TDD, etc.)
- Suggest testing strategy (unit, integration, e2e tests)
- Recommend CI/CD approach

### 8. Project Complexity Assessment
- **Complexity Rating**: Low, Medium, or High
- **Estimated Phases**: Recommended number of development phases (e.g., 2-3 for Low, 4-6 for Medium, 7+ for High)
- **Justification**: Brief explanation of why this complexity level was chosen based on requirements, tech stack, and scope.

## Output Format

Please structure your response as a well-formatted markdown document with clear sections and subsections. Use bullet points, code blocks, and diagrams (ASCII art or mermaid) where helpful.

Be thorough but concise. Focus on actionable insights that will guide the development process.
