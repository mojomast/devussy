# Design Iteration Review

You are reviewing a generated project design before proceeding to devplan generation.
This is your opportunity to refine, correct, or add to the design.

## Current Project Design

**Project Name:** {{ project_design.project_name }}

### Objectives
{% if project_design.objectives %}
{% for obj in project_design.objectives %}
- {{ obj }}
{% endfor %}
{% else %}
- No objectives defined
{% endif %}

### Technology Stack
{% if project_design.tech_stack %}
{% for tech in project_design.tech_stack %}
- {{ tech }}
{% endfor %}
{% else %}
- No tech stack defined
{% endif %}

{% if project_design.database %}
### Database
- {{ project_design.database }}
{% endif %}

{% if project_design.deployment_platform %}
### Deployment Platform
- {{ project_design.deployment_platform }}
{% endif %}

{% if project_design.apis %}
### External APIs
{% for api in project_design.apis %}
- {{ api }}
{% endfor %}
{% endif %}

{% if project_design.user_emphasis %}
### Previously Emphasized Requirements
The following points were marked as important during the initial interview:

{% for emphasis in project_design.user_emphasis %}
- "{{ emphasis }}"
{% endfor %}
{% endif %}

### Architecture Overview
{{ project_design.architecture_overview | default("No architecture overview provided.") }}

{% if project_design.dependencies %}
### Key Dependencies
{% for dep in project_design.dependencies %}
- {{ dep }}
{% endfor %}
{% endif %}

{% if project_design.challenges %}
### Identified Challenges
{% for challenge in project_design.challenges %}
- {{ challenge }}
{% endfor %}
{% endif %}

{% if project_design.mitigations %}
### Mitigations
{% for mitigation in project_design.mitigations %}
- {{ mitigation }}
{% endfor %}
{% endif %}

{% if complexity_profile %}
### Complexity Assessment
- **Score:** {{ complexity_profile.score }}/20
- **Depth Level:** {{ complexity_profile.depth_level }}
- **Estimated Phases:** {{ complexity_profile.estimated_phase_count }}
{% endif %}

## Validation Results

{% if validation_report %}
{% if validation_report.is_valid %}
**Status:** PASSED - No issues found
{% else %}
**Status:** NEEDS REVIEW - Issues found

### Issues to Address
{% for issue in validation_report.issues %}
- **{{ issue.code }}**: {{ issue.message }}
{% endfor %}
{% endif %}
{% else %}
*No validation report available*
{% endif %}

## Your Review Focus Areas

Please consider the following areas during this review:

1. **Completeness** - Are all requirements captured?
2. **Technical Feasibility** - Is the proposed architecture realistic?
3. **Integration Points** - Are all integration risks identified?
4. **Missing Requirements** - Did we miss anything important?
5. **Prioritization** - Should any features be emphasized more?

If something is particularly important to you, make sure to emphasize it clearly so it can be captured for the devplan phase.

Type `/done` when you're satisfied with the design and ready to proceed to devplan generation.
