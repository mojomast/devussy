{# Follow-up Questions Template for Complexity Analysis Clarifications #}
{# Used when complexity analyzer has low confidence and needs more context #}

Based on our initial conversation, I need some clarification to better understand your project's complexity.

{% if complexity_profile %}
**Current Assessment:**
- Complexity Score: {{ complexity_profile.complexity_score }}/20
- Estimated Phases: {{ complexity_profile.estimated_phases }}
- Confidence: {{ (complexity_profile.confidence * 100) | round(1) }}%
{% endif %}

{% if follow_up_questions %}
**Clarification Questions:**
{% for question in follow_up_questions %}
{{ loop.index }}. {{ question }}
{% endfor %}
{% endif %}

---

Please answer these questions to help refine the project complexity assessment. You can:
- Answer each question directly
- Type "skip" to proceed with the current assessment
- Type "/done" when finished

{% if interview_data %}
**Previously Collected Information:**
{% for key, value in interview_data.items() %}
{% if value %}
- **{{ key | replace('_', ' ') | title }}**: {{ value }}
{% endif %}
{% endfor %}
{% endif %}
