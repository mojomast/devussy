  "requirements": "A satirical 2D fighting game for M.U.G.E.N featuring 8 resourceful underdog characters with unique weapons, aesthetics, finishers, and personal 'Bum Hymns'. Dark comedy tone that punches up at corrupt systems (landlords, politicians, dystopian capitalism) while maintaining empathy. Hand-drawn/pixel-art hybrid style with expressive visuals and over-the-top special moves. Each fighter needs complete sprite sheets, signature weapon, 3 special moves, 1 super, 1 finisher, home stage, and victory music."
