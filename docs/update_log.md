### Phase 2: Core Abstractions - IN PROGRESS (6/13 steps complete)

**Summary:** Implemented LLM client abstractions and provider-specific implementations.

**Completed Steps:**
- 2.2: Abstract LLMClient interface (src/llm_client.py)
  - Abstract base class with async-first design
  - async generate_completion() for single prompts
  - async generate_multiple() for concurrent batch requests
  - generate_completion_sync() wrapper with event loop detection
- 2.3: OpenAI client (src/clients/openai_client.py)
  - AsyncOpenAI integration with chat completions
  - Exponential backoff retry logic via tenacity
  - Support for model, temperature, max_tokens, top_p parameters
- 2.4: Generic OpenAI-compatible client (src/clients/generic_client.py)
  - aiohttp-based async HTTP client
  - Works with any OpenAI-compatible endpoint
  - Custom base_url and API key support
- 2.5: Requesty client (src/clients/requesty_client.py)
  - Placeholder implementation for Requesty API
  - aiohttp with exponential backoff
  - Documented expected API format
- 2.6: Client factory (src/clients/factory.py)
  - create_llm_client() factory function
  - Routes to appropriate provider based on config
  - Validates provider selection (openai, generic, requesty)

**Next Steps:**
- 2.7: Implement concurrency control wrapper
- 2.8: Implement retry decorator
- 2.9: Define data models
- 2.10: Implement template loader
- 2.11: Implement file manager
