# LLM Complexity Analysis

## Profile Summary
- **Score**: 18.0
- **Estimated Phases**: 4
- **Depth Level**: detailed
- **Confidence**: 0.85

## Rationale
The project involves complex multi-tenant architecture, real-time synchronization, extensive integrations with cloud providers and third-party services, security and compliance requirements, and deployment on Kubernetes, indicating high complexity. The scope covers multiple features that require careful coordination, testing, and operational planning.

## Hidden Risks
- Potential delays in multi-cloud integration and testing
- Security vulnerabilities due to complex encryption and multi-tenant architecture
- Operational challenges in managing real-time synchronization at scale
- Compliance risks if regulations evolve during development

## Follow-up Questions
- What is the expected initial deployment timeline?
- Are there specific compliance standards besides SOC2 and HIPAA to consider?
- What is the target user base size and expected data volume?
- Are there existing infrastructure constraints or preferences?
- What is the planned approach for ML model training and integration?
