# LLM Complexity Analysis

## Profile Summary
- **Score**: 14.0
- **Estimated Phases**: 4
- **Depth Level**: standard
- **Confidence**: 0.75

## Rationale
The project involves building a REST API with multiple complex features such as user authentication, real-time notifications, and integrations with external services. The requirements specify security, scalability, and testing, which increase complexity. The team size suggests a small but capable team, reducing some risks. The use of multiple frameworks and external APIs adds integration challenges.

## Hidden Risks
- Potential challenges in real-time WebSocket implementation at scale
- External API dependencies may introduce unpredictable delays
- Security risks associated with authentication and external integrations

## Follow-up Questions
- What are the expected user load and concurrency levels?
- Are there specific compliance standards to meet?
- Is multi-tenancy required?
- What is the target deployment environment?
