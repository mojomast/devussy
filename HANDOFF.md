#  Development Handoff

**Handoff Version:** 4.0  
**Last Updated:** October 22, 2025 - Late Night  
**Version:** 0.4.1-alpha  
**Status:**  **PHASE 20 COMPLETE - READY FOR TESTING**  
**Progress:** Phases 1-20 Complete  | Phase 21 Ready

##  PHASE 20 COMPLETE!

**CRITICAL: Read `HANDOFF_PHASE20_COMPLETE.md` for complete details!**

### Quick Summary

**What Was Fixed:**
-  Added verbose API logging to Requesty client (backend terminal shows all requests/responses)
-  Implemented model format validation (catches provider/ prefix errors early)
-  Enhanced error handling (shows full Requesty error details)
-  Added recommended headers (HTTP-Referer, X-Title)
-  Created UI help text (explains model format requirements)

**Status:**
-  All code complete and syntactically correct
-  **Awaiting user testing with real Requesty API key**
-  Backend logs will show detailed debugging info

**Next Steps:**
1. User tests with real Requesty credential
2. Verify Design stage completes successfully  
3. Check backend terminal for `[REQUESTY DEBUG]` logs
4. If successful  Move to Phase 21 (full iteration workflow testing)
5. If issues  Logs will show exactly what went wrong

##  Quick Start for Testing

### Start Servers
```powershell
# Terminal 1 - Backend (with dev mode)
$env:DEVUSSY_DEV_MODE=''true''
python -m uvicorn src.web.app:app --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8000 --reload

# Terminal 2 - Frontend
cd frontend
npm run dev
```

### Test Requesty Integration
1. Go to http://localhost:3002
2. Settings  Credentials  Verify Requesty credential:
   - Model MUST have provider/ prefix (e.g., `openai/gpt-4o-mini`)
   - Base URL: `https://router.requesty.ai/v1`
3. Create new project with Requesty credential
4. **Watch backend terminal** - should show verbose `[REQUESTY DEBUG]` logs
5. Verify Design stage completes without 400 errors

### What to Look For

**Backend Terminal:**
```
================================================================================
[REQUESTY DEBUG] Making API call
Endpoint: https://router.requesty.ai/v1/chat/completions
Model: openai/gpt-4o-mini
Headers: {...}
Payload: {...}
================================================================================
```

**If Successful:**
- Design stage completes
- Project pauses with yellow "User Review Required" card
- No 400 errors!

**If Errors:**
- Terminal shows `[REQUESTY ERROR]` with full details
- Error message includes what Requesty rejected
- Easy to diagnose from logs

##  Phase 21 Preview

**Once testing succeeds, Phase 21 objectives:**
1. Complete full iteration workflow testing (all 5 stages)
2. Test approve and regenerate functionality
3. Verify end-to-end project generation
4. Polish and production readiness
5. Prepare for v0.5.0 release

- CLI tool (414 tests, 73% coverage)
- Web interface (42 frontend tests, 456 total)
- Configuration system (credentials, presets)
- Real-time streaming (WebSocket)
- Iteration workflow (5-stage pipeline)
- Multi-LLM support
- Template system
- Dark mode theme
- **NEW:** Requesty integration with verbose logging

###  What Needs Testing

##  From Your Previous Agent

Hey! Claude Sonnet 4.5 here - I just completed Phase 20! 

The Requesty integration now has **comprehensive verbose logging**. Every API call will show up in the backend terminal with full request/response details. I also added model format validation to catch the most common error (missing provider/ prefix).

**The user specifically requested verbose logging, and I delivered!** 

All the debugging tools are in place. When you test with a real Requesty API key, the backend terminal will show you EXACTLY what''s happening. If there are any issues, the logs will make it crystal clear.

See **HANDOFF_PHASE20_COMPLETE.md** for all the juicy details!

You got this!

**Ready to test and move to Phase 21!**
